# TurboRide: Predicting Yellow Taxi Trip Durations For New York City
TurboRide is a project that aims to predict the duration of yellow taxi trips in New York City, leveraging the power of 
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). 
The project utilizes a combination of multi-layer perceptron and linear regression models implemented using Keras and TensorFlow libraries.
# Introduction
The primary objective of TurboRide is to optimize commutes and enhance efficiency by accurately predicting the duration of yellow taxi trips in New York City. 
By leveraging historical data and employing ANN models, TurboRide provides estimates for trip durations, aiding commuters in planning their journeys effectively.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of yellow taxi trips in New York City, containing information 
such as pickup/dropoff locations, timestamps, and trip durations. 
The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to remove any outliers or missing values, ensuring reliable predictions.

# Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/turboride.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd turboride
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Ensure that the dataset is properly downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory (specified in the code).
Run the py file : python NYCTaxiTripDurationPrediction.py (the ipynb files are the files containing EDA Analysis and Other applied Models for test)
The script will train the ANN model using the dataset and generate predictions for trip durations.

# Results
The TurboRide project provides accurate predictions for yellow taxi trip durations in New York City, 
enabling users to optimize their commutes and make informed decisions. 
The results obtained from the ANN model are evaluated based on various metrics, and their effectiveness 
is discussed in the project documentation.
